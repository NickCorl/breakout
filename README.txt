Why does Breakout 2.0 deserve 100 points?

Our breakout 2.0 game implements creative, visually appealing, and overall exciting CSS3 features and JavaScript.

CCS3 Features:

We believe breakout 2.0 demonstrates an ellegant usage of several CSS3 features. First of all, our game uses beautiful
rounded corners introduced with CSS3. For all major 'div' elements and to frame our canvas we utilized rounded corners
through the 'border-radius' attribute to make the html page be much more visually appealing and inviting to the user.
Additionally, our html page shows great use of the gradient feature added with CSS3. Our team specifically chose to
implment a pleasent and smooth linear gradient for the main background of our html page and several headers. To ensure
that this is viewed exactly the same across all browsers our team chose to add additional CSS3 lines to properly implement 
the gradient. Several other key CSS3 features used all delt with the appearance of text on scree. Using the new CSS3 word 
wrap feature we made the instructions of the game be readable and wrap nicely around to the left of teh cavas/game screen.
Additionally, we utilized fun text shadows features introduced in CSS3 with a blur effect to make the most important 
headers stick out. Finally, with our game's theme being driven by the randomly generated rainbow of colors for the blocks,
we also utilized the animation feature of CSS3 to animate the coloring of the main breakout 2.0 header.

JavaScript Features:

Apart from the CSS and visual appeal of the game, our team believes that we effectively and creatively utilized JavaSript to
implement Breakout 2.0. The game mechanics of Breakout with the addition of mouse input and keyboard was a bit tricky to implement
but our team feels that we have created efficient ways to create an overall fluid and classic breakout experience. One feature of the
game that was a bear to implement was the creation of the grid of blocks in the game that are then able to be collided with
and broken. After much trial and error our implmented solution includes a loop to create the block objects with default parameters
of position, color, and a broken/unbroken boolean. When drawn the blocks are evenly spaced with offsets and then looped through to
check collision with the ball. Creation of objects with default values in JavaScript was something new to our team and it stands as
a solution that we are proud of. Furthermore, our team feels that our creative use of JavaScript allowed us to keep fluid gameplay
and menu navigation. With mouse and keyboard events our game feels very responsive and has good user interface. Using the mouse as our
team chose to use the mouse hovering over canvas to control the paddle so the user will never feel cheated of the speed of arrow 
key movement method to play the game (moving the paddle), it is all in the users control to get to the ball. Additionally, our team utilized 
JavaScript to check for keyboard events when navigating our in game menus. Overall the user gets a very responsive fluid interface throughout
the game. Finally, our team feels that our implmentation of simple random number generators using JavaScript math functions throughout the game 
makes the game stand out from others. From random colors of the blocks to varying ball speed, the randomness and varying challenge makes the 
game a fun unique experience everytime. 


In the end, our team feels that we created a bowser game worthy of being played by everyone. With only the power of html, CSS, and JavaScript
Breakout 2.0 revives the legacy of the classic breakout game, and gives the user a well-rounded experience that is most certainly a great time 
killer.
